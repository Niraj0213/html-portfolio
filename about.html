<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Niraj Sunar. 
I am an aspiring IT professional with a strong interest in technology, software, and digital innovation. 
I completed my 12th grade from the NEB board in the science stream, which gave me a solid foundation in logic,
problem-solving, and analytical thinking.

After completing my studies, I became increasingly interested in the field of computer applications, 
especially in web development, design, and programming. I have started learning HTML and enjoy creating 
simple yet meaningful real-time projects like blog pages, image galleries, and interactive web elements. 
These experiences have sparked my passion for building creative and user-friendly websites.</p>

<p>My next goal is to pursue a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) 
at a reputed private college in Vijayanagar, Bangalore,preferably within an affordable fee structure. 
I am particularly interested in evening or part-time courses so I can continue learning independently
 and possibly work or intern during the day. I strongly believe in continuous improvement and hands-on learning.
 Though Iâ€™m just starting out, I am eager to learn languages like CSS, JavaScript, Python, and even get 
 into backend development in the future.</p>

<p>Aside from academics, I lead a disciplined, vegetarian lifestyle, and I try to stay focused on my health and studies. 
i am naturally curious, self-motivated, and always open to learning new skills and taking on challenges.
My long-term vision is to become a professional developer or tech entrepreneur 
who can create useful digital solutions that solve real-world problems. I value hard work, integrity, and consistency.
I am committed to turning my passion for technology into a successful and meaningful career.</p>
